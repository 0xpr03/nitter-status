Mostly autogenerated entities.
Caveats: `state` mod has to be re-added upon invocation.
All `DateTime` types are lost too, as they can't be deduced from sqlite.

Re-generating entities:
- `cargo install sea-orm-cli`
- (windows) `$Env:DATABASE_URL='sqlite:./sqlite.db?mode=rwc'` / (unix) `DATABASE_URL=..` (or whatever else is in your .env)
- `sea-orm-cli generate entity -o entities/src --with-serde serialize`
- fixup `DateTime` types and `state` mod
