      <ul>
        <li><code>Country</code> for the host country reported in the instance wiki.</li>
        <li><code>Healthy</code> stands for hosts which are reachable and pass a content check. Known bad hosts are marked with a ‚ùì, these instances block healthchecks.</li>
        <li><code>Average Time</code> is the response time average over the last {{ping_avg_interval_h}} hours. This is not a network ping.</li>
        <li><code>All Time %</code> for all time percentage of the instance being healthy.</li>
        <li><code>RSS</code> whether the host has RSS feeds enabled.</li>
        <li><code>LSH</code> Last Seen Healthy, for the last time an instance was seen healthy.</li>
        <li><code>Nitter Version</code> which nitter version the host reports.</li>

      <h4>API</h4>
      The same data as visible in the website/table can also be fetched as JSON from <code>/api/v1/instances</code> (<a rel="nofollow" href="/api/v1/instances">link</a>).
      Note that the data only changes in the intervals stated <a href="#update-interval">above</a>. Thus requesting it very often will get you rate limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please <b>do not use instances listed here for scraping(<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">?</a>) !</b>
      Instead <a href="https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/#docker">host your own</a> nitter instance, so public instances can be used by less tech savy people and not get overrun by you. You can get help with that at the listed matrix channel.
    </p>
    <p>The purpose of this API is to serve services like Twiiit, Farside or people looking for indication that their RSS feed is down - but not scrapers. Scraping will bring the downfall of public instances.</p>
